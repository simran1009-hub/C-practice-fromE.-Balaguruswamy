/*
Identify errors, if any, in each of the following array declaration statments, assuming that ROW and 
COLUMN are declared as symbolic constants:
(e) double salary[ i + ROW]
*/

/*
Error: Inside the bracket where we write the size of the array, one can only
        write constants and not variables.
        Hence, its corrected syntax will be: double salary[constant]
