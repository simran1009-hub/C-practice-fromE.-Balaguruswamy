/*
Identify errors, if any, in each of the following array declaration statments, assuming that ROW and 
COLUMN are declared as symbolic constants:
(h) int array x[COLUMN];
*/

/*
Error: The error in this is the space left between 'array' and 'x'. In C, variable names cannot have
        spaces in between.
        Hence, the corrected code will be: int array_x[COLUMN];
